<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Duygu. I am a student in the computer engineering department. This year is my last year.
   I finished all my courses a semester early. My last responsibility these days is a long-term internship.
   Nowadays my Gano is 3.25 and when I do my internship my Gano will increase. I am a hardworking and successful student. 
   While I'm in my last semester, I don't have any classes so I have a lot of recess time.
   So I decided to become a front-end developer. I tried many areas of software throughout my school life. 
   For example, Data Analyst, Machine Learning,
   Business Analyst, Test Automation... and Python, Java, many frameworks, etc. I learned many technologies. 
   However, I decided that the most suitable field for me was the front end. Thus my journey began.
</p>

<p>I want to be a really good frontend developer so I study hard for this wish. I start my long and nice journey and I believe in myself that 
  I will be successful as a end of the my journey. Yes I know, coding journey never finish it is always developing but I can so successful
  in this field. In summary I have a dream and I start study hard for this dream. I will become a really good frontend developer soon.</p>

<p>Except the coding, I have other hobbies. For example I'm doing cute arts with using drawning. And I also want to learn stock
  photography but I didn't start yet. Maybe later. I am also good at computer games :D.
